**Welcome to my website, showcasing some of my favourite projects and presentations. Thanks for taking a look!**

Navigating and understanding the growing world of data and technologies is becoming increasingly complex. I work at the 
intersection of data and strategy, helping to explain the stories we can uncover behind data, to support good decision 
making and to help make places better for people and the environment. 

I'm passionate about helping people understand the numbers and what they mean for different people, places and projects. 
Some of my favourite things to do are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💻 Build interactive data dashboards and websites  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌏 Analyse geospatial data and make maps  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📊 Crunch numbers and present data in useful ways 

I'm motivated by working towards making the world a better place, and am always looking for more opportunities to translate data into useful tools to help people better understand and improve the world we live in.
