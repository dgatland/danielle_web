At the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Oceania 2019 conference, I presented on how 
we at MRCagney measured access to frequent public transport for key urban centres in New Zealand, for the New Zealand 
Transport Agency. This was a project we conducted annually for the New Zealand Transport Agency for several years to
inform their annual reporting and metrics for the transport network performance across New Zealand.

In my presentation, I discussed:

* Considerations for access by public transport, such as spatially where you can get and what destinations are accessible in that area
* What counts as frequent transit versus rapid transit, when comparing what type of public transport people have access to
* A walkthrough of the process and Python code to get the frequent and rapid public transport routes, and compute the walking catchments to them
* Some considerations when using a live API service like OpenStreetMap, which is constantly changing and being updated
