At the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Oceania 2023 conference, I gave a tutorial-style 
presentation on how to create a data collection app using QGIS and either one of the two leading data collections apps 
for QGIS: Mergin Maps or QField. 

FOSS4G is about "free and open source software for geospatial" and the presentations at the FOSS4G conferences are often 
very inclusive and transparent with people sharing their experiences, code, and projects, and collaborating to 
help improve the skills of everyone. 

It was the spirit of FOSS4G and open collaboration that encouraged me to present in more of a 'tutorial' format, with 
the goal of creating a recorded presentation that both conference attendees and others (after) would be able to follow 
as a step-by-step guide to create their own data collection apps.

It has also proved as a reference point and reminder for me of some of the tips and tricks I have learnt for creating 
these apps over numerous projects.
