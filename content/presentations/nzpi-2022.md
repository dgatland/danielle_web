At the New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI) Conference 2023, I presented with my client, Hamish Sykes from Whangārei
District Council, on the [Whangārei Housing Capacity and Feasibility Model]({{<ref "projects/whangarei-housing-model/">}}) 
that we built for them.

We presented on:

* The requirements of the National Policy Statement on Urban Development, for housing capacity and feasibility modelling
* The design requirements and scoping of our model to ensure it met both the national regulations and the district's needs
* The multi-disciplinary collaboration required to develop the tool
* An overview and walkthrough of the tool in action and how the Council uses it
