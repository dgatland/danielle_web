the rapid generation of large datasets, varying by age, planting density and background weather conditions. These 
datasets can then be used for the research and development of vision-based machine learning algorithms."

As part of a research and development project at Carbon Critical, I built a 3D modelled landscape in Blender for 
creating simulated renders of pine plantations. Initially, I simulated a single pine plantation from which we could 
render images from different positions and angles. I then extended this model using Blender's Python integration to be
able to simulate variations to:

* The age of the pine plantation, including both the size of trees and "tree thinning" over time.
* The planting density of trees, representing the spacing and variability of spacing between trees.
* Lighting and cloud coverage of the sky in the background.

I used these Python integrations to automatically produce a large dataset of images of pine plantations, which could
then be used for training potential machine learning models.
