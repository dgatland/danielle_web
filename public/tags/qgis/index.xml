      <description>In my work at MRCagney, we would occassionally undergo spatial data collection activities. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of our core work and would happen only a few times per year. We had never found the opportunity to invest the time to develop an app-based approach for data collection activities (and were instead still using pen and paper!). I used the opportunity of an upcoming project along with some free time to investigate the options for app-based spatial data collection.</description>
