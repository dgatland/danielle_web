      <title>3D Modelling Forests to Create Synthetic Training Data for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>As part of a research and development project at Carbon Critical, I built a 3D modelled landscape in Blender for creating simulated renders of pine plantations. Initially, I simulated a single pine plantation from which we could render images from different positions and angles. I then extended this model using Blender&amp;rsquo;s Python integration to be able to simulate variations to:&#xA;The age of the pine plantation, including both the size of trees and &amp;ldquo;tree thinning&amp;rdquo; over time.</description>

      <title>Mapping Realistic Travel Time Catchments for Public Transport</title>

      <description>In my public tranport planning work at MRCagney, I was often asked how we could better communicate the impacts of frequency and time of day on travel time catchments. A travel time catchment (an &amp;ldquo;isochrone&amp;rdquo;) is a map where an area is coloured to show what places are accessible within a travel time limit from a given origin.&#xA;Traditionally, a single isochrone map would be produced for a given journey start time, e.</description>

      <title>Building Data Collection Apps</title>

      <description>In my work at MRCagney, we would occassionally undergo spatial data collection activities. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of our core work and would happen only a few times per year. We had never found the opportunity to invest the time to develop an app-based approach for data collection activities (and were instead still using pen and paper!). I used the opportunity of an upcoming project along with some free time to investigate the options for app-based spatial data collection.</description>
