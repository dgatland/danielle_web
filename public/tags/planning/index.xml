      <description>In my work at MRCagney, we would occassionally undergo spatial data collection activities. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of our core work and would happen maybe 1-2 times per year. We had never found the opportunity to invest the time to develop an app-based approach for data collection activities. I used the opportunity of an upcoming project along with some free time to investigate the options for app-based spatial data collection. Although I knew ArcGIS had enterprise solutions, I was particularly interested in what we could do with QGIS, the open source alternative, and my preferred geospatial software.</description>

      <title>Mapping Realistic Travel Time Catchments for Public Transport</title>

      <description>In my public tranport planning work at MRCagney, I was often asked how we could better communicate the impacts of frequency and time of day on travel time catchments. A travel time catchment (an &amp;ldquo;isochrone&amp;rdquo;) is a map where an area is coloured to show what places are accessible within a travel time limit from a given origin.&#xA;Traditionally, a single isochrone map would be produced for a given journey start time, e.</description>
