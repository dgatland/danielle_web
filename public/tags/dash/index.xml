      <description>This was a personal interest project I took on during one of Auckland&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 lockdowns. As New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s borders went through various levels of restrictions on international travel to New Zealand, I was curious to see how the international arrivals compared to previous years. And particularly to monitor over time how international arrivals would increase after the restrictions ended (and when we would return to the same volumes of travellers as pre-COVID).</description>
