This webinar is about a project I led while working at [MRCagney](https://mrcagney.com). I led the 
development of an online housing capacity model for Whangārei. The model computes the plan-enabled
and commercially feasible housing capacity of the urban environment of Whangārei. It was 
developed to help the Council meet the statutory requirements of the National Policy Statement on 
Urban Development (2020). 

In this webinar, Hamish Sykes (from Whangārei District Council) and I talk about:

* What was required of the model
* Scoping and designing the online model framework
* An overview of what the model looks like and how it works
* How Council has used the tool 

You can read more about it and try a demo version of the model from 
[mrcagney.works](https://mrcagney.works/whangarei-housing-assessment.html).
